Cone of probability
Cone decides possible rotations and directions a branch can extend to
Cone's angle and min/max distance is based on a combination of current nodes rotation AND all previous nodes along that branch

Cone angle phi = Current Nodes Angle (0.5 weight) + Sum of all previous node angles (0.5 weight)
Angle decision is made randomly, weighted towards the outer edges (Radius R from center of cone, Angle Theta about cone center, Length l of branch)
coneMin = VAR(prevL * 0.6)
coneMax = VAR(prevL * 0.7)
branchWidth = L * VAR(0.1)

Radius r = sqrt(random(0,1))
Theta = randm(0,2PI)
l = random(coneMin, coneMax)
